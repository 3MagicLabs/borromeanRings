## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Headless generator + generate → gate → retry → escalate loop conformance (#202, ADR-0078, the build phase of #143): `generate.sh` is a second generator adapter with **no model behind it** — it runs `[generator].command` with the project path, the last verdict and the failing check ids, learns "a change is written" from exit 0 plus a changed dirty-tree OID, runs the gate itself, and exits `0` green / `1` escalated / `2` generator-failed / `3` refused. The loop's rules left both shell scripts: `meta_harness.generator` now owns the retry cap (read by `stop_gate.sh` *and* the driver; a test asserts neither hardcodes it, and an unreadable cap falls back to **one** attempt) and `next_action(attempt, cap, gate_ok, tree_changed, exit_code)`, a pure, exhaustively-tested decision. The generator cannot touch what the gate owns: a write anywhere under `.meta-harness/` while it runs is detected (size + mtime either side) and ends the run as `generator-failed`, so resetting the retry counter forges nothing — and the counter is never handed over as a path, only as a number. Verdicts now record **who** produced the change they judged (`intent.generator`: `claude-code:<session_id>` from the Stop hook, `headless:<command>` from the driver, `""` when unset — provenance the gate makes no decision on, read after `ok` is decided). Conformance: the four scenarios of SPEC-generator.md §3.2 (fixed-on-retry → green at attempt 2, never-fixed → escalated after exactly 3 gate runs, no-change → escalated with the gate never asked, crash → generator-failed with the log kept) plus two negative fixtures (one resets the counter, one edits a receipt in an earlier bundle — caught, and the edited bundle stops verifying). Every one was shown to fail against a deliberately regressed loop. One spec correction came out of building it: SPEC-generator.md N3 said "the tree changed" is the dirty-tree OID, but 08_branch, 09_commits, 11_changelog and 13_adr read the branch and the history — a generator that amends a commit message changes what the gate sees and no file at all, so the driver compares the executor's full snapshot identity `(branch, head, dirty tree)`, with a fixture that discriminates. Refusal (exit 3, "nothing to drive") is pre-flight only, and a config that is present and broken exits 4 rather than 3, so an orchestrator can never skip a run where something was attempted or a governed project whose config broke. The change detection covers `(branch, head, dirty tree, all refs, the index)` — `git update-ref` and `git rm --cached` each move what the gate reads while the first three stay identical — and always excludes `.meta-harness/`, gitignored or not: the driver's own capture of the generator's stdout used to live in the gated tree, so on a project without that ignore (which `init.sh` never writes) a generator that wrote **nothing** was reported green. The evidence guard hashes content rather than reading size and mtime, which one `os.utime` could restore. And `rm .meta-harness/stop_attempts/*` — which used to give a hooked agent an unbounded retry loop — no longer works on its own: `stop_gate.sh` takes the attempt as `max(counter + 1, trailing failures for this session's label in the append-only verdict history)`. That is a speed bump and the docs say so: deleting the history, appending one forged green row, or relabelling the rows each still defeat it, and the headless driver is not anchored at all (its label is per-command, not per-run-key). A bound that holds against a generator that means to break it needs the count out of the generator's reach — filed as #218 for both adapters. One test asserted **git's** error prose (`unrecognized input` on git 2.34, `No valid patches in input` on 2.55) and so went red in CI on a git release rather than on a defect; the fixture now emits its own marker and the test asserts that. Sweeping the class found a second instance that had not failed yet — a fixture moving `refs/heads/main` is a no-op where `init.defaultBranch` is `main` — plus two global-config dependencies (`apply.whitespace`, `commit.gpgsign`). ADR-0077 pins the tools whose output decides a verdict, but only Python distributions; for `git` the mitigation has to be not to read the prose at all.
- Executor and generator interfaces, spec-first (#143, ADR-0071): `docs/specs/SPEC-executor.md` names the contract for "run this check against this snapshot and return a receipt" — snapshot identity (head + dirty-tree OID + branch), receipt/log/sidecar outputs, eight guarantees (isolation, determinism as equivalence, boundedness, fail-closed `error`/125 receipt on executor failure, no rewriting in transit, same harness, same branch) — and three executors: `local` (today, the reference), `worktree` (a git worktree per run, basis for #144), `sandbox` (contract only, #145 builds). `docs/specs/SPEC-generator.md` names what the gate needs from whatever produces the next change (deliver verdict, request retry with failing ids, bounded retry then a human, identity as self-declared provenance in `intent.generator`) and two generators: `claude-code` (the Stop hook as it is) and `headless` (a scripted, model-free generator for tests and #144). Conformance tests are the definition of done; `local` and the hooked agent stay the only implementations until #201 / #202 land. Substrate (ADR-0069), executor and generator are stated as three separate axes. Docs only — nothing built.
- Multi-harness substrate research and spec (#142, ADR-0069): `docs/research/HARNESS-SUBSTRATES.md` surveys Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Hermes, Aider, Cline and Roo Code from their public docs (dated, URL per cell, "not documented" never guessed); `docs/specs/SPEC-substrate-adapter.md` writes down the stdin/stdout/exit contract the six hooks already implement, the `adapters/<name>/` wiring-only shape, the capability matrix, degraded modes and the conformance test. Decision: one gate and one hook set with per-substrate wiring adapters; phase-1 target Codex CLI filed as #194. Docs only — nothing built.
- Claude Code plugin distribution: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, a self-hosted single-plugin marketplace, `hooks/hooks.json` wiring the six hooks through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (scripts unchanged), project skills exposed by symlink; one-line install from a checkout or the GitHub URL, per-project opt-in untouched. `docs/PLUGIN.md` (ADR-0057, #136).
- PreCompact snapshot + SessionStart(compact|resume) re-injection of the governance brief (last verdict, open obligations, enforcement, identity policy) so gate state survives context compaction; hook-event inventory in `docs/HOOK-EVENTS.md` (ADR-0053, #137).

- Honest no-op status + source-coherence guard + self-status (ADR-0049) — the fix for a
  **hollow green**. A governed project reported `ok: true`, 12/12, while seven of those
  checks had inspected *nothing*: `src_dir` pointed at a missing `src/` and the real code
  lived in `tools/`. Root cause: `_lib.sh` derived status from the exit code alone, so "I
  inspected nothing" and "I inspected everything and it's clean" were indistinguishable
  (`50_security` was worst — `bandit -r src` on a missing dir exits 0 with *empty* output).
  Four parts: (1) a fourth receipt status **`noop`** (`emit_noop`, plus exit code 3 as the
  heredoc→bash signal), surfaced in the gate output (`inspected NOTHING: N of M`), the
  persisted verdict and its history; (2) **fail-closed by allowlist** —
  `verdict.NON_FAILING_STATUSES` / `is_failing()` replace the old `status != "pass"`
  negation, so an unknown/typo'd/forged status still fails (regression-tested), and
  `status_assess` no longer mislabels a `noop` check as *failed*; (3) **`01_source_coherence`**,
  which fails the gate when a declared source path resolves to nothing *while tracked
  source exists elsewhere*, naming where the code actually is — genuine greenfield stays
  green as `noop`, and untracked files never fail a gate; (4) **self-status**: `status.sh`
  now reports **this project** by default (governed? enforcement AUTO/PARTIAL/MANUAL? last
  verdict? how many checks were hollow?), with the `$HOME` portfolio roster demoted to
  opt-in `--all`, plus a `borromeanrings-status` skill so any session can be asked "check
  my borromeanRings status". Enforcement is detected by hook *script name*, not path, so a
  self-governing repo isn't misreported as unenforced. Unit- + integration-tested
  (misconfigured fixture gates red; greenfield gates green-as-noop; correctly-configured
  passes for the right reason). Remaining vacuity in `05_hygiene`/`07_layout`/`09_commits`
  is documented as deferred in the ADR — the hollow count is a floor, not a total.
- Harness versioning + per-run version stamping (ADR-0048): a top-level `VERSION` file
  (`0.1.0`) as the human-declared release marker, and every gate run now records **which
  borromeanRings governed it**. `verify.sh` computes `HARNESS_VERSION` from
  `git describe --tags --always --dirty` on `BORROMEANRINGS_HOME` (honest about
  dirty/ahead-of-tag state), falling back to `VERSION`. It's printed in the gate output
  (`harness-version:`), carried on the persisted `Verdict` (new `harness_version` field →
  `last_verdict.json` + `verdict_history.jsonl`, back-compatible default `""`), and written
  as `harness_version.txt` into the receipt bundle. Answers "is it stable / which version
  verified this project?". Surfacing it as a `status.sh` column is a deferred follow-up.
- Checks catalog (`docs/CHECKS.md`): the single reference for **every** check (all 27 across
  the shared / Python / heavy-CI lanes) — what each enforces, its `borromeanrings.toml`
  config keys, its lane, whether it's a threshold-free ratchet, and its ADR. Plus how to
  enable a check (`init.sh`/`adopt.sh`/manual) and how to opt a project into *automatic*
  governance (the per-project hooks model). Closes the "how do I know how to use all its
  features" gap.
- Effectiveness ledger (ADR-0047): `ledger.sh` + `meta_harness.ledger` + append-only
  verdict history — answers "is governing this project actually *catching* anything?"
  (which `status` can't). `verify.sh` now appends each run's `Verdict` to
  `.meta-harness/verdict_history.jsonl` (best-effort, alongside the last-verdict write);
  `read_history`/`append_history` are fail-soft (missing → `[]`, bad lines skipped).
  `ledger.sh [PATH ...]` renders per project: gate RUNS, failures CAUGHT (the gate is
  load-bearing, not decorative), and current pass/fail STREAK, plus a portfolio tally.
  Reuses `discover_projects` + the gate's own verdict; pure core, unit-tested (100%),
  threshold-free (counts + streak, no score). Ratchet-baseline movement deferred to a
  follow-up.
- Portfolio status / roster view (ADR-0046): `status.sh` + `meta_harness.status` +
  `meta_harness.verdict` — the missing view *across* governed projects. One table shows,
  per project: git-or-not, required-check count, last gate verdict
  (`pass`/`fail`/never-gated), config drift (uncommitted `borromeanrings.toml`), and
  adoption drift (recommended checks not yet required, via `plan_adoption`). The gate
  now persists a compact last-known `Verdict` to `.meta-harness/last_verdict.json`
  (best-effort — a write failure never turns a PASS into a FAIL); `status` reads it, so
  the default view is instant. `--run` re-gates each project first (authoritative,
  CI-usable exit); `--list` prints paths. Reuses the single sources of truth
  (`load_config`, `plan_adoption`/`RECOMMENDED`, the gate's own verdict) — no duplicated
  policy. Threshold-free (a per-project table, not a blended score). Unit-tested (100%,
  23 cases) + dogfooded on the maintainer's real 10-project portfolio.
- Static accessibility (a11y) invariants gate (ADR-0045): `15_a11y` +
  `meta_harness.accessibility` — the deterministic, threshold-free slice of matrix #6
  (Product/UX). Native stdlib `html.parser` scan of tracked `*.html`/`*.htm`/`*.xhtml`
  (minus `[a11y].exclude`) reports WCAG-cited violations for a per-project rule set
  `[a11y].require`: `html_lang` (a full document declares a non-empty `<html lang>` —
  WCAG 3.1.1), `img_alt` (every `<img>` carries an `alt`; `alt=""` allowed — WCAG
  1.1.1), `page_title` (a full document has a non-empty `<title>` — WCAG 2.4.2).
  Document-level rules gate on the presence of `<html>`, so HTML *fragments* are never
  falsely flagged. No tracked HTML ⇒ pass. Dogfooded on **fire** (Electron; five
  renderer pages, *all* missing `<html lang>` — the justified need); borromeanRings has
  no HTML so it does not declare the check. Threshold-free (no Lighthouse-style score);
  rendered a11y (contrast/ARIA/focus) is deferred to a future heavy lane. Unit-tested
  (11 cases) + adversarially verified.
- Container (Dockerfile) hygiene gate (ADR-0044): `14_container` +
  `meta_harness.container` — the deterministic, threshold-free slice of matrix #4
  (SRE / operational). Native stdlib Dockerfile parse (multi-stage, line-continuations,
  comments, registry `host:port`, digests) reports violations for a per-project rule
  set `[container].require`: `non_root` (final stage must end on a non-root `USER`),
  `pinned_base` (external `FROM` pins a non-`latest` tag or digest; `scratch`/`$`-var
  exempt), `healthcheck` (a `HEALTHCHECK` is declared). No Dockerfile ⇒ pass. A
  run-and-exit gate-runner omits `healthcheck`; a service keeps the full set. Fixes
  borromeanRings's **own** image (was root — added a non-root `USER`) and dogfoods
  `["non_root", "pinned_base"]` on it; the full set is validated against AutoApply's
  real service Dockerfile (flags its missing HEALTHCHECK). Unit-tested (13 cases) +
  adversarially verified.
- ADR-discipline gate (ADR-0043): `13_adr` + `meta_harness.adr_discipline` — on a
  feature branch (name starts with `[adr].require_prefixes`, default `feat/`), a
  change that touches `src` must also add/modify an ADR under `[adr].dir`
  (`docs/adr/`), so a new capability can't land with no recorded decision. Fills
  coverage-map rows D/H; deterministic, threshold-free, git-derivable (merge-base
  diff, `--relative` so it works for git-root and subdir projects). The buildable,
  no-telemetry slice of the delivery/process matrix. Native, unit-tested +
  adversarially verified.
- Secret-scanning completeness (ADR-0042): `74_secret_history` (heavy lane) scans
  every blob reachable from any ref for high-confidence secrets — a
  committed-then-deleted secret still lives in history and is compromised.
  Reachable-only (dangling objects excluded), fail-closed, deduped by a one-way
  fingerprint (the secret is never emitted); acknowledge rotated/benign findings
  via `[secrets].history_allow`. Native (`meta_harness.secret_history`),
  unit-tested + adversarially verified. Also hardens `12_secrets` to **fail
  closed on a non-git directory** (was a vacuous pass — found in rollout).
- Adoption helper for existing projects: `adopt.sh` + `meta_harness.adopt` —
  migrates a project already governed at the founding baseline onto the newer
  quality/security checks. Plans the missing recommended set (`12_secrets`,
  `11_changelog`, `32_complexity`, `33_coupling`, `45_docstrings`), seeds each
  ratchet's baseline from current state, creates a `CHANGELOG.md` if needed, and
  rewrites `[checks].required` in place. Idempotent, native, no installs.
  Complements `init.sh` (new projects); piloted on `reliefq` 7 → 12 checks green
  (ADR-0041).
- Public-API breaking-change detection: `34_api_diff` — diffs the public
  surface vs the merge-base; a removed symbol / removed-renamed param / new
  required param fails unless `[api].allow_breaking=true`. Native ast+git,
  dogfooded on `examples/textkit` (ADR-0040).
- Example governed project: `examples/textkit` — a small library (different
  archetype) with its own `borromeanrings.toml`, governed by borromeanRings's
  gate end-to-end (11 checks). Proves the 'any project' portability claim; a
  permanent integration test asserts its gate passes.
- Coupling ratchet: `33_coupling` — worst-case efferent coupling (fan-out) over
  the internal module graph, non-regression, native (ADR-0038).
- Critic activation: `scripts/critic-judge.sh` (provider-agnostic, fail-closed
  judge — claude CLI or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) + `docs/CRITIC-ACTIVATION.md`; the
  Wave-2 critics are now one config line from live (ADR-0030/0036).
- Agent-enhancement recommender (advisory): `meta_harness.enhancements` — a
  curated, maintainer-verified catalog of open-source tools that improve the
  *wrapped agent* (model routing, MCP servers, observability, caching), with a
  `[enhancements].interests` filter. Proposes, never gates (ADR-0037).
- **Enforcement-coverage program** — turning the SWE best-practice matrix into
  real gates:
  - Adversarial self-test corpus: the gate must reject known-bad and accept
    known-good (ADR-0025).
  - Tamper-evident receipts: content digest + fail-closed verdict, run-digest
    anchor (ADR-0026).
  - Native import-direction architectural fitness: `leaves` / `private` /
    `forbidden` / `forbid_cycles` contracts over the internal module graph
    (ADR-0027).
  - Changelog discipline (this check): presence + `Unreleased` section, with an
    opt-in strict "entry on source change" rule (ADR-0028).
  - Native secret scanning: high-confidence provider tokens + private keys in
    tracked files, fail-closed, `allow-secret` escape hatch (ADR-0032).
  - Docstring-coverage ratchet: native, non-regression, no absolute target
    (ADR-0029).
  - Wave-2 critic rubrics (advisory): `56_critics` judges functions against
    error-handling / naming / security / boundary-value / test-smell rubrics
    via a live model judge; a DRY registry over the doc-drift machinery,
    dormant until `[critic].judge_command` is wired (ADR-0036).
  - Doc-drift critic: first live application of the T2 seam — a model judge
    external to the generator checks docstrings against code; advisory-first,
    opt-in via `[critic].judge_command` (ADR-0030).
  - Cyclomatic-complexity ratchet: native McCabe, worst-case non-regression, no
    absolute ceiling (ADR-0031).

  - Mutation-score ratchet (heavy): `60_mutation` runs mutmut in CI and
    ratchets assertion strength vs `.borromeanrings-mutation-baseline`
    (0.80; current 0.83), fail-closed on 0-evaluated (ADR-0022).
  - License compliance (heavy): `72_licenses` runs pip-licenses in CI and
    denies incompatible copyleft (`[licenses].deny`), with `allow_packages`
    exceptions (ADR-0035).
  - Dependency CVE audit (heavy): `70_pip_audit` runs pip-audit in CI and
    fails on known vulnerabilities; base tooling / accepted CVEs ignorable
    via `[audit]` (ADR-0034).
  - CI-tier heavy lane: `verify.sh --heavy` runs + requires `checks/ci/`
    (`[checks].heavy`), the home for expensive tool-checks; landed dormant
    (ADR-0033).

### Changed
- Enforcement-coverage map corrected to reality: coverage-ratchet was mis-claimed
  ✅ but no check exists (now ❌ candidate); coupling (`33_coupling`), public-API
  breaking-change (`34_api_diff`), and the adoption path (`adopt.sh`) marked ✅;
  doc-drift noted as activation-paused (agent-only, no API keys); added §6 for the
  other governance matrices (security, DORA, SRE, data/ML, product/UX).
- Grouped `tests/` into `unit/` (23) + `integration/` (5 shell-out tests); layout
  threshold back to 15; mutmut ignore paths updated; retires the 30 workaround.
- Enforcement-coverage map refreshed to reflect the shipped suite (T1 filled,
  T2 critic seam + rubric family live-advisory); honest scorecard updated.
- Changelog strict rule (`require_entry_on_src_change`) turned **on** now the
  PR queue has cleared (ADR-0028).

### Notes
- Earlier increments that are in review: mutation-score ratchet (ADR-0022),
  external rubric-critic seam (ADR-0023), project profiler (ADR-0024), and the
  enforcement-coverage map.
