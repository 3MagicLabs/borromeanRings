# Changelog

All notable changes to borromeanRings are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Discipline is enforced by check `11_changelog`: this file must exist and carry an
`## [Unreleased]` section (a home for pending changes). The stricter
"every source change updates the changelog" rule is available via
`[changelog].require_entry_on_src_change` and will be enabled once the current PR
queue is merged.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Session charter gate (ADR-0063, #173): a committed `CHARTER.toml` (goal, stakes `low`|`high` — two opt-in tiers, never a dial — done_when/stop_when/may_not, owner; `high` also requires rollback/reviewer/blast_radius) validated fail-closed by `22_charter` via the pure `meta_harness.charter` (every violation as `field — reason`, hedged `done_when` items rejected, unknown keys/stakes rejected, never `noop`); `[charter]` spine block; a sub-120-byte UserPromptSubmit reminder when enabled and the file is missing; this repo declares its own high-stakes charter. Mechanism re-authored from a CC BY-NC-SA source — no text or code copied.
- Claude Code plugin distribution: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, a self-hosted single-plugin marketplace, `hooks/hooks.json` wiring the six hooks through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (scripts unchanged), project skills exposed by symlink; one-line install from a checkout or the GitHub URL, per-project opt-in untouched. `docs/PLUGIN.md` (ADR-0057, #136).
- PreCompact snapshot + SessionStart(compact|resume) re-injection of the governance brief (last verdict, open obligations, enforcement, identity policy) so gate state survives context compaction; hook-event inventory in `docs/HOOK-EVENTS.md` (ADR-0053, #137).

- PreCompact snapshot + SessionStart(compact|resume) re-injection of the governance brief (last verdict, open obligations, enforcement, identity policy) so gate state survives context compaction; hook-event inventory in `docs/HOOK-EVENTS.md` (ADR-0053, #137).

- Fast (interactive) lane: `verify.sh --fast` (closes #226). The Stop hook ran the full
  required set on every turn — 445 s, of which `40_test` was 404 s (91%) — so an agent
  waited over seven minutes to report finished, and three retries made the worst case ~22
  minutes per session. `--fast` exports `BORROMEANRINGS_LANE=fast` and runs the same check
  set; only `40_test` narrows, to the paths a project declares in the new `[test].fast_paths`
  (`Config.test_fast_paths`), without coverage. This repo declares `["tests/unit"]`: the Stop
  gate is now ~12 s. Declaring nothing means no fast lane and no behaviour change; `--heavy`
  always wins over `--fast`; CI still runs everything. A fast-lane pass is labelled as partial
  in the verdict line, the check row, the receipt (`lane`, `fast_paths`, no coverage number)
  and `last_verdict.json`, so it can never be read as a full pass. See ADR-0081.

### Fixed
- Git-identity guard hardened against per-command overrides and exotic invocations
  (closes #54). Two independent holes, both preventive-layer only (check `06_git_identity`
  remained the backstop). **(1) Overrides were invisible.** The guard compared the repo's
  *configured* identity, but git accepts an identity per invocation — `--author=`,
  `-c user.email=`, and the `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*` environment variables — none
  of which config-comparison can see, so a correct repo could still produce a
  wrong-authored commit. **(2) Detection was a substring match.** Keying on the literal
  `"git commit"` misses every spelling that puts something between the two words
  (`git -c … commit`, `git -C dir commit`, `VAR=value git commit`) — so those invocations
  skipped the identity *and* protected-branch guards entirely. New `git_subcommand()`
  parses the real subcommand, stepping over leading environment assignments and git's
  global options; `command_override_violation()` compares any declared override against
  the required identity, allows one that states the correct identity (being explicit is
  not evasion), and refuses an override it cannot parse rather than failing open. Both
  guards now key off the parsed subcommand. Scoped so it only ever fires on a real
  `git commit`/`push`: a script or heredoc that merely mentions git is not a commit.
  Verified end to end against all four evasion paths through the hook's own stdin
  protocol, with negative controls.
  Those hook tests now run against a throwaway governed project (configured identity =
  declared identity, HEAD on a work branch) instead of the harness checkout: CI's checkout
  has no `user.name`/`user.email`, so the configured-identity rule denied every commit
  there — failing the negative control and letting the override test pass for the wrong
  reason. The override test now also asserts the denial came from the override rule.
- `merge.sh` now merges the **governed project**, not borromeanRings itself (closes #121).
  It unconditionally `cd`-ed into `BORROMEANRINGS_HOME`, so invoking it from a governed
  project checked *borromeanRings's* working tree for dirtiness and would have merged
  *borromeanRings's* branches — the wrong repository. Found in the field: an untracked file
  in the harness blocked a clean merge in another repo. `verify.sh` has always honoured
  `BORROMEANRINGS_PROJECT`/`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`; `merge.sh` now resolves the same two roots
  (ADR-0013) and runs every git/`gh` call, the gate, the policy check and the audit receipt
  against `PROJECT_ROOT`, while loading harness code from `BORROMEANRINGS_HOME`. It also
  refuses outright when the target has no `borromeanrings.toml`. Regression-tested against
  a real fixture repo with a local bare origin; both tests fail against the pre-fix script
  with the exact symptom from the report.
### Security
- Gate no longer self-certifies via a planted stdlib name (ADR-0080, #222). `verify.sh`
  ran its trusted Python (verdict aggregation, language detect) and `checks/_lib.sh` ran
  `emit_receipt` / `borromeanrings_project_cfg` from `PROJECT_ROOT` — putting the
  governed project first on `sys.path`, so a `json.py` committed at the repo root could
  shadow stdlib and make `bash verify.sh` (what CI runs) print `RESULT: PASS` and exit 0
  on a failing tree, forging the required `gate` check. New `checks/_py.sh` defines
  `borromeanrings_py` (runs Python from `/` with `PYTHONPATH` at borromeanRings' own
  `src`, plus `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` so a user-site `usercustomize.py` cannot forge the
  verdict either — #224 review; mirrors #221's hook helper); the four named calls plus
  every verdict-deciding analysis heredoc (`05`–`15`, `32`–`35`, `45`, `55`, `56`, `74`)
  and `00_build`'s stdlib `compileall` step now route through it. Deliberately not
  `python3 -P`/`-I` (3.11-only / drops `PYTHONPATH`). Tool runs that execute project code
  by design (`pytest`, `mypy`, `mutmut`, `pip-audit`, `pip-licenses`, and `00_build`'s
  `import <package>` half) are left as-is — already untrusted per #218, blocked on M7.
  This closes the project-directory shadow completely and the user-site vector; it is not
  full interpreter isolation. The Stop-hook half of #222 (forged `last_green_state`, hook
  markers) also remains, on M7.
### Fixed
- The Stop hook's retry count could be reset by deleting a file (#218, ADR-0079). It lived
  in `.meta-harness/stop_attempts/`, inside the project, and a missing file read as `0`. It
  now lives under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/borromeanrings/<project-digest>/`,
  keyed by the project's resolved path, via the new `meta_harness.retry_state` (pure, 100%
  unit-tested). This resists accident and a naive reset: tidying `.meta-harness/`, deleting
  the counter or writing `0` into it no longer buys attempts. It is **not** a bound against
  intent: the gate runs the project's own tests as the user, so a `conftest.py` can still
  delete the count, as can any same-user process; only an isolated test run closes that.
  Keyless. Fails closed: a broken or unusable state directory, one that resolves inside the
  project, or a symlink on the old in-tree path now escalates to the human instead of
  silently counting from zero. The old in-tree count is carried over with `max()`, walked
  without following symlinks, then removed. The headless driver from #217 must adopt the
  same module when it lands.
- Hooks no longer import modules from the governed project. They run from the project
  directory, where `python3 -c` put a planted `json.py` ahead of the standard library; the
  Stop hook's payload parse imported one and got a fresh session id on every Stop. Every
  hook now starts Python through `borromeanrings_py` (`.claude/hooks/_lib.sh`), which runs
  it from `/`. Not `-P`, which needs Python 3.11 against `requires-python = ">=3.10"`.
### Deprecated
- The pre-rename config file name `borromeo.toml` (issue #62). It still loads —
  `meta_harness.spine.resolve_config_path` falls back to it when `borromeanrings.toml`
  is absent and prints a `FutureWarning` to stderr (once per process per legacy file;
  shown by Python's default filters, which a `DeprecationWarning` is not). Visible from
  `verify.sh` (its own notice on every run), `status.sh`, `ledger.sh`, the Stop and
  UserPromptSubmit hooks; the PreToolUse branch guard swallows stderr by design and stays
  silent but still governs — so no already-governed project falls out of governance. Migrate with `git mv borromeo.toml borromeanrings.toml`.
  The `meta_harness` package and the `.meta-harness/` evidence directory are deliberately
  NOT renamed (receipts, baselines, mutmut config and import paths depend on them).

### Added
- Prior-art gate (ADR-0051, closes #131): `17_prior_art` — on a feature branch, a change
  that **adds public surface** must also add or modify a survey record under
  `docs/surveys/` saying what already existed (in the repo, a dependency, the ecosystem)
  and why building was still right. The `13_adr` pattern applied to reuse; the practice the
  maintainer most often re-stated to agents by hand, now enforced. New surface is computed
  by diffing `api_diff.public_api` at the merge-base vs HEAD; no new surface ⇒ `noop`.
  Ships with its own survey (`docs/surveys/0001-prior-art-gate.md`) and a `TEMPLATE.md`.
  Two honest limits from the research (`docs/research/AGENT-TOOLING-SURVEY.md`): the
  ecosystem "is there a library?" half is **advisory only** — no key-free package API
  supports free-text search, so a gate could not answer its own question; and clone
  detectors catch copy-paste, not reinvention (renamed clones evade them), so jscpd is
  deferred and will be described as copy-paste detection. Reimplementation-of-a-builtin
  IS deterministic: Ruff's `PIE807`/`PERF401-403`/`PLR0402` are now enabled — selected
  **individually**, because the `PIE`/`PERF`/`PL` groups measured 50 findings on this
  tree, 37 magic-value nits and 3 `too-many-arguments` (a numeric threshold, the exact
  thing this project rejects). Their one finding was fixed, not suppressed.
- `describe.sh` (`--json`, `--readme`) + `04_self_description`: the capability report is generated from the check registry, the README block is regenerated in place, and a README that states a check/gate count must match the registry (ADR-0052, #132).
- **Verification ladder, tier 1 — property-based tests (ADR-0074, #140).** The gate can now
  run a project's *universal* statements, not just its examples. `27_properties` runs the
  suite declared at `[verification].properties` (pytest + Hypothesis) under a **binary,
  threshold-free** rule: nothing declared ⇒ `noop` (rule off) · **declared but empty ⇒
  `fail`** · runner not importable ⇒ `noop` **naming it** (borromeanRings never installs a
  project's toolchain) · a falsified property ⇒ `fail`. It **never counts properties, never
  ratchets on how many exist, and never targets a number of examples** — ADR-0022 chose a
  mutation ratchet over a coverage percentage for exactly this reason, and "number of
  properties" is the same trap one rung up; the file probe is `find … -print -quit`, so the
  check is structurally unable to see a count. Declared-but-empty fails because
  `[verification]` has **no defaults**: writing the key is an affirmative claim, and a claim
  with no evidence behind it is the vacuity ADR-0049 exists to catch (`pass` would be that
  defect verbatim; `noop` would make the declaration free). An **unknown key under
  `[verification]` fails config loading closed** (`spine.VERIFICATION_KEYS`), so a typo
  (`propertys = …`) can't silently switch a verification claim off. Order of evaluation is
  part of the contract: everything decidable *without* a runner is decided first, so a
  missing tool can never mask a broken claim. Unit-tested on the spine (including the
  fail-closed typo) + eight integration cases driving the real `verify.sh`, each shown to
  fail under a deliberate sabotage of the branch it covers. **Tiers 2 (SMT) and 3 (formal
  proof) ship as specification only** — `docs/specs/SPEC-verification-ladder.md` covers all
  three with their honest limits (an SMT proof covers the model you wrote, not the code you
  shipped; a proof of the wrong theorem is worth nothing, so the *statement* is the reviewed
  artifact) — with acceptance criteria filed as #204 and #205. z3 and CrossHair are not on
  this machine and nothing was installed to change that. borromeanRings declares the check
  and **no** property directory, so its own gate honestly reports `noop — rule off`; no
  suite was invented to make the check look busy. `adopt.py`'s `RECOMMENDED` set is
  unchanged: adopting a verification tier is a project's decision, not a migration's.
- Mutation-guard proof + evaluated count on the gate row (issue #187). `60_mutation` has
  failed closed on zero evaluated mutants since ADR-0022; it is now pinned by
  `tests/integration/test_mutation_guard.py`, which plants a unit test that reads a path
  outside `src/`/`tests/` (the #160/#168 shape — absent from mutmut's copied sandbox) and
  asserts `60_mutation` is `fail` with "MUTATION CHECK DID NOT RUN", then removes it and
  asserts `pass` with a real count. Checks may now write a one-line `summary` field into
  their receipt (`meta_harness.mutation.summary_line` for 60_mutation); the gate prints it
  beside the status (`meta_harness.verdict.status_label`, validated + bounded) so the row
  reads `PASS (evaluated N, score S)` / `FAIL (evaluated 0)` — a score alone is unreadable.
- `60_mutation` clears the stale `mutants/` copy before each run. mutmut 3.6's
  `copy_src_dir` skips any target that already exists and never deletes, so a test removed
  from `tests/` lingered in the sandbox and kept the lane red — the root cause of the
  "`rm -rf mutants/` before a heavy run" rule. Bounded to `$PROJECT_ROOT/mutants`; refuses
  a path that resolves outside the project. The integration test's second run now passes
  without cleaning up itself, which is the regression proof.
- Provenance gate `25_provenance` (ADR-0070, `docs/specs/SPEC-provenance.md`, closes #189):
  re-authored text must not reproduce its declared source. The ADR-0020 rule for the 4D
  merge (#172) was enforced by review alone, and review found copied or clause-for-clause
  passages in two of five ports after the builder had reported them clean; the reviewer's
  shingle sweep lived only in a scratchpad. Now a check: every file changed since the
  merge-base under `[provenance].paths` is split into **6-word shingles** (lowercased,
  Unicode punctuation stripped, whitespace collapsed, code fences skipped) and compared
  with every file under `[provenance].sources` (config, then the colon-separated
  `BORROMEANRINGS_PROVENANCE_SOURCES` env var — so a machine-local sibling path never
  lands in the config). **Binary, no score**: any overlap not covered by
  `[provenance].allow` fails, printed as `changed:line ↔ source:line — "<shingle>"`;
  the gate never guesses which overlaps are "generic" — the human allowlists them with a
  reason, in a reviewable diff. No `[provenance]` ⇒ off (`noop`); no sources or nothing
  changed under `paths` ⇒ `noop`; absent/unreadable/empty source, git error inside a
  repo, or an allow entry that normalizes to nothing ⇒ **fail closed**. Self-quotes
  (overlap among this repo's own files, or a source inside the project) are never
  findings. Pure core `meta_harness.provenance` (100% line+branch, exact-value tests);
  end-to-end tests on a fixture repo + fixture source cover off / noop / pass / fail with
  locations / allowlisted / unreadable source / env-var. This repo declares
  `sources = []` (honest `noop` until the maintainer sets the env var) and registers the
  check in `[checks].required`; `adopt.sh`'s RECOMMENDED set is unchanged (opt-in).
- Predicate lint (`23_predicates`, `meta_harness.predicates`, ADR-0064, #174): the
  checkable statements this repo's documents make — SPEC `Contract`/`Guarantees`/
  `Acceptance` bullets, ADR `Consequences` bullets phrased must/never/shall, issue-form
  task items — are now read by a gate. Any **hedge word** ("appropriately", "as needed",
  "reasonable"; a fixed list organised by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 §5.2.7's ambiguity categories,
  extended per project via `[predicates].hedges`) fails the gate as
  `file:line — predicate — hedge`, and any SPEC that names **no** shipped check id, existing
  test file or issue is reported as an **orphan**. Only resolvable references count, so the
  orphan rule cannot be vacuous — a mutation-driven test replaces the detector with one that
  finds nothing and asserts the suite notices (the defect 4D's validator shipped). Opt-in via
  `[predicates].enabled`; `noop` when off or when nothing was found; fails closed on an
  unreadable file. Dogfooded: five hedged predicates in this repo's SPECs/ADRs were rewritten
  as yes/no statements and five orphan SPECs now name their unit-test file.
- Governance matrices #2–#6 documented (#138) — `docs/matrices/` holds one row-by-row
  document each for **security & compliance**, **delivery / DORA**, **operational / SRE**,
  **data / ML** and **product / UX**, plus an index of the shared conventions. Every row is a
  binary check or a threshold-free ratchet (never a percentage target), names the check that
  enforces it today — verified against the script, e.g. `14_container` rule `healthcheck`,
  `15_a11y` rule `html_lang`, `74_secret_history` — or the gap issue that would close it, is
  tagged deterministic-now / telemetry-gated / archetype-blocked (the last wired to #79), and
  cites a checkable source (OWASP ASVS 4.0.3, NIST SSDF, SLSA, OpenSSF Scorecard, DORA /
  *Accelerate*, Google SRE Book and Workbook, CIS Docker Benchmark, ML Test Score, WCAG 2.2,
  Nielsen heuristics). `docs/ENFORCEMENT-COVERAGE.md` §6 now links each matrix and reports it
  as `documented` (the `archetype` status word is retired: archetype-blocked is a row
  property, not a matrix status).
- Tests for the portability entry points (closes #53). `init.sh`, `install-global.sh` and
  `merge.sh` are the code that reaches *outside* this repository — into a governed
  project's config, into a user's global Claude settings, into another repo's git history
  — and none of it was tested. `init.sh` also now substitutes the `__BORROMEANRINGS_HOME__` placeholder in copied
  skills, which `install-global.sh` always did and it did not — a skill still carrying
  it tells the agent to run a path that does not exist. `init.sh`: the written config
  loads through the spine, all
  four hooks are wired at this borromeanRings, an existing config is not clobbered, skills
  are installed, and **the gate then runs green in the freshly-initialised project** (a
  starter config that cannot pass its own gate would make every adoption start red).
  `install-global.sh`: hooks are installed, unrelated settings survive, a *foreign* hook on
  the same event is kept, re-running does not duplicate entries, and the
  `__BORROMEANRINGS_HOME__` placeholder is substituted. Every one of those redirects the
  script with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — a test that wrote to the real `~/.claude` would
  silently re-enable global governance on the developer's machine. `merge.sh`: refuses a
  dirty tree, refuses when already on the base branch, and refuses when the gate fails,
  asserting in each case that nothing was merged.

### Fixed
- Git-identity guard hardened against per-command overrides and exotic invocations
  (closes #54). Two independent holes, both preventive-layer only (check `06_git_identity`
  remained the backstop). **(1) Overrides were invisible.** The guard compared the repo's
  *configured* identity, but git accepts an identity per invocation — `--author=`,
  `-c user.email=`, and the `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*` environment variables — none
  of which config-comparison can see, so a correct repo could still produce a
  wrong-authored commit. **(2) Detection was a substring match.** Keying on the literal
  `"git commit"` misses every spelling that puts something between the two words
  (`git -c … commit`, `git -C dir commit`, `VAR=value git commit`) — so those invocations
  skipped the identity *and* protected-branch guards entirely. New `git_subcommand()`
  parses the real subcommand, stepping over leading environment assignments and git's
  global options; `command_override_violation()` compares any declared override against
  the required identity, allows one that states the correct identity (being explicit is
  not evasion), and refuses an override it cannot parse rather than failing open. Both
  guards now key off the parsed subcommand. Scoped so it only ever fires on a real
  `git commit`/`push`: a script or heredoc that merely mentions git is not a commit.
  Verified end to end against all four evasion paths through the hook's own stdin
  protocol, with negative controls.
  Those hook tests now run against a throwaway governed project (configured identity =
  declared identity, HEAD on a work branch) instead of the harness checkout: CI's checkout
  has no `user.name`/`user.email`, so the configured-identity rule denied every commit
  there — failing the negative control and letting the override test pass for the wrong
  reason. The override test now also asserts the denial came from the override rule.
- `merge.sh` now merges the **governed project**, not borromeanRings itself (closes #121).
  It unconditionally `cd`-ed into `BORROMEANRINGS_HOME`, so invoking it from a governed
  project checked *borromeanRings's* working tree for dirtiness and would have merged
  *borromeanRings's* branches — the wrong repository. Found in the field: an untracked file
  in the harness blocked a clean merge in another repo. `verify.sh` has always honoured
  `BORROMEANRINGS_PROJECT`/`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`; `merge.sh` now resolves the same two roots
  (ADR-0013) and runs every git/`gh` call, the gate, the policy check and the audit receipt
  against `PROJECT_ROOT`, while loading harness code from `BORROMEANRINGS_HOME`. It also
  refuses outright when the target has no `borromeanrings.toml`. Regression-tested against
  a real fixture repo with a local bare origin; both tests fail against the pre-fix script
  with the exact symptom from the report.

### Added
- Shell lint gate (ADR-0050, closes #52): `16_shellcheck` lints the project's own shell,
  **fail-closed on any finding at any severity**. borromeanRings is 43 scripts / ~2.8k lines
  of bash and that bash IS the trust root — the gate itself, every check, the four Claude
  hooks — yet it was the one part of the codebase nobody linted while the Python beside it
  faced twenty checks. Running it found five issues, **two of them real defects**:
  `scripts/critic-judge.sh` piped its prompt into `python3 - <<'PY'`, where the heredoc
  overrides the pipe, so `sys.stdin.read()` returned `""` and the API-key judge path was
  sending an **empty prompt** to the model (SC2259); and `pre_bash_guard.sh` carried a dead
  `case` alternative in the dangerous-command guard, unreachable because an earlier pattern
  subsumed it (SC2221/SC2222). Both fixed, plus an unchecked `cd` in `merge.sh` (SC2164) and
  a missing shell directive. Design notes: sources are **resolved, not suppressed** — `-x`
  with `[shell].source_paths` (`SCRIPTDIR`) clears all 33 SC1091 notes that a blanket
  `-e SC1091` would have muted along with real unreadable-source bugs; the file list is
  git-tracked shell (an untracked scratch script never fails a gate) with a filesystem-walk
  fallback; no shell ⇒ `noop`, not a hollow pass; and **no `xargs`**, which would split a
  long list across invocations and report only the last exit code. `shellcheck-py` is added
  to the dev extras so CI needs no apt step. A missing shellcheck is `error`, never a skip.
- Honest no-op status + source-coherence guard + self-status (ADR-0049) — the fix for a
  **hollow green**. A governed project reported `ok: true`, 12/12, while seven of those
  checks had inspected *nothing*: `src_dir` pointed at a missing `src/` and the real code
  lived in `tools/`. Root cause: `_lib.sh` derived status from the exit code alone, so "I
  inspected nothing" and "I inspected everything and it's clean" were indistinguishable
  (`50_security` was worst — `bandit -r src` on a missing dir exits 0 with *empty* output).
  Four parts: (1) a fourth receipt status **`noop`** (`emit_noop`, plus exit code 3 as the
  heredoc→bash signal), surfaced in the gate output (`inspected NOTHING: N of M`), the
  persisted verdict and its history; (2) **fail-closed by allowlist** —
  `verdict.NON_FAILING_STATUSES` / `is_failing()` replace the old `status != "pass"`
  negation, so an unknown/typo'd/forged status still fails (regression-tested), and
  `status_assess` no longer mislabels a `noop` check as *failed*; (3) **`01_source_coherence`**,
  which fails the gate when a declared source path resolves to nothing *while tracked
  source exists elsewhere*, naming where the code actually is — genuine greenfield stays
  green as `noop`, and untracked files never fail a gate; (4) **self-status**: `status.sh`
  now reports **this project** by default (governed? enforcement AUTO/PARTIAL/MANUAL? last
  verdict? how many checks were hollow?), with the `$HOME` portfolio roster demoted to
  opt-in `--all`, plus a `borromeanrings-status` skill so any session can be asked "check
  my borromeanRings status". Enforcement is detected by hook *script name*, not path, so a
  self-governing repo isn't misreported as unenforced. Unit- + integration-tested
  (misconfigured fixture gates red; greenfield gates green-as-noop; correctly-configured
  passes for the right reason). Remaining vacuity in `05_hygiene`/`07_layout`/`09_commits`
  is documented as deferred in the ADR — the hollow count is a floor, not a total.
- Harness versioning + per-run version stamping (ADR-0048): a top-level `VERSION` file
  (`0.1.0`) as the human-declared release marker, and every gate run now records **which
  borromeanRings governed it**. `verify.sh` computes `HARNESS_VERSION` from
  `git describe --tags --always --dirty` on `BORROMEANRINGS_HOME` (honest about
  dirty/ahead-of-tag state), falling back to `VERSION`. It's printed in the gate output
  (`harness-version:`), carried on the persisted `Verdict` (new `harness_version` field →
  `last_verdict.json` + `verdict_history.jsonl`, back-compatible default `""`), and written
  as `harness_version.txt` into the receipt bundle. Answers "is it stable / which version
  verified this project?". Surfacing it as a `status.sh` column is a deferred follow-up.
- Checks catalog (`docs/CHECKS.md`): the single reference for **every** check (all 29 across
- Checks catalog (`docs/CHECKS.md`): the single reference for **every** check (all 27 across
  the shared / Python / heavy-CI lanes) — what each enforces, its `borromeanrings.toml`
  config keys, its lane, whether it's a threshold-free ratchet, and its ADR. Plus how to
  enable a check (`init.sh`/`adopt.sh`/manual) and how to opt a project into *automatic*
  governance (the per-project hooks model). Closes the "how do I know how to use all its
  features" gap.
- `docs/RENAME.md` (issue #62): the borromeo -> borromeanRings rename tail — what was
  renamed, what deliberately was not and why, and the exact commands to fix a local
  clone's remote URL, re-run `install-global.sh`, and refresh the GitHub label
  descriptions that still say "borromeo".
### Changed
- Enhancement catalog health-audited (#133): entries carry `maintained_as_of` / `needs_api_key` / `applies_to`, `recommend()` filters by substrate, RouteLLM (dead) and OmniRoute (search-query URL) removed, Serena / Repomix / ast-grep / pyright-lsp added.

### Added
- Issue forms, PR template, and label scheme (closes #61): YAML issue forms for bug
  report (repro, expected/actual, gate output + receipt path, `harness-version`),
  feature request (user story, acceptance checkboxes, quality attributes, the check
  that would enforce it, ADR/milestone fit) and research/spike (question, sources,
  deliverable under `docs/research/`); blank issues disabled, vulnerabilities routed to
  the private advisory. `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` now mirrors the real definition of
  done (fast gate, `--heavy` with `60_mutation`/`74_secret_history`, sub-agent review
  on the PR, ADR/CHANGELOG/spec when applicable, no new CI/packaging, subject ≤ 72).
  `docs/LABELS.md` documents the label + milestone vocabulary reconciled with the
  labels that exist; `scripts/labels.sh` (idempotent, `--dry-run`, shellcheck-clean)
  applies it — run by a human on purpose, never by a hook.
- Platform self-assessment (`docs/SELF-ASSESSMENT.md`, issue #51): how the gate, receipts,
  hooks, ratchets and lanes work with every claim cited; the defect-class table built from
  this cycle's 25 sub-agent PR reviews (#148–#185) plus the full-source licence sweep, and
  whether a mechanism or only review catches each class; gaps ranked fail-closed → vacuous evidence → matrix coverage →
  ergonomics; ten prioritised improvements with tracking issues (four newly filed:
  #186 fail-closed enumeration, #187 mutation-lane vacuity guard, #188 citation check,
  #189 license shingle check); the constraints honoured and where each is enforced.
- Toolchain pinning (ADR-0077): `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` pins with `==`
  every package that decides a verdict — the check tools, plus `coverage` (measures the
  ratchet) and `libcst` (generates mutmut's mutants). The rest of the closure stays free
  to resolve current, because pinning it froze four packages at versions with known CVEs
  and `70_pip_audit` correctly went red. `meta_harness.toolchain` + integration tests fail
  closed when the gate runs a version other than the pinned one, when a version cannot be
  read, when a `dev` requirement is not exact, or when a tool reachable from `checks/**.sh`
  has no pin. Each tool is observed through **the argv its check uses** (`ruff` from
  `PATH`, `pytest` via `python3 -m`), because those resolve to different installs on a
  machine with a user-site shim.
- CI prints the log of every check that did not pass, marking checks outside the required
  set as advisory. A red gate used to name the failing check and nothing else. Adding a check that
  invokes a new binary now also requires registering and pinning it; the failure message
  names the three steps.
- Effectiveness ledger (ADR-0047): `ledger.sh` + `meta_harness.ledger` + append-only
  verdict history — answers "is governing this project actually *catching* anything?"
  (which `status` can't). `verify.sh` now appends each run's `Verdict` to
  `.meta-harness/verdict_history.jsonl` (best-effort, alongside the last-verdict write);
  `read_history`/`append_history` are fail-soft (missing → `[]`, bad lines skipped).
  `ledger.sh [PATH ...]` renders per project: gate RUNS, failures CAUGHT (the gate is
  load-bearing, not decorative), and current pass/fail STREAK, plus a portfolio tally.
  Reuses `discover_projects` + the gate's own verdict; pure core, unit-tested (100%),
  threshold-free (counts + streak, no score). Ratchet-baseline movement deferred to a
  follow-up.
- Portfolio status / roster view (ADR-0046): `status.sh` + `meta_harness.status` +
  `meta_harness.verdict` — the missing view *across* governed projects. One table shows,
  per project: git-or-not, required-check count, last gate verdict
  (`pass`/`fail`/never-gated), config drift (uncommitted `borromeanrings.toml`), and
  adoption drift (recommended checks not yet required, via `plan_adoption`). The gate
  now persists a compact last-known `Verdict` to `.meta-harness/last_verdict.json`
  (best-effort — a write failure never turns a PASS into a FAIL); `status` reads it, so
  the default view is instant. `--run` re-gates each project first (authoritative,
  CI-usable exit); `--list` prints paths. Reuses the single sources of truth
  (`load_config`, `plan_adoption`/`RECOMMENDED`, the gate's own verdict) — no duplicated
  policy. Threshold-free (a per-project table, not a blended score). Unit-tested (100%,
  23 cases) + dogfooded on the maintainer's real 10-project portfolio.
- Static accessibility (a11y) invariants gate (ADR-0045): `15_a11y` +
  `meta_harness.accessibility` — the deterministic, threshold-free slice of matrix #6
  (Product/UX). Native stdlib `html.parser` scan of tracked `*.html`/`*.htm`/`*.xhtml`
  (minus `[a11y].exclude`) reports WCAG-cited violations for a per-project rule set
  `[a11y].require`: `html_lang` (a full document declares a non-empty `<html lang>` —
  WCAG 3.1.1), `img_alt` (every `<img>` carries an `alt`; `alt=""` allowed — WCAG
  1.1.1), `page_title` (a full document has a non-empty `<title>` — WCAG 2.4.2).
  Document-level rules gate on the presence of `<html>`, so HTML *fragments* are never
  falsely flagged. No tracked HTML ⇒ pass. Dogfooded on **fire** (Electron; five
  renderer pages, *all* missing `<html lang>` — the justified need); borromeanRings has
  no HTML so it does not declare the check. Threshold-free (no Lighthouse-style score);
  rendered a11y (contrast/ARIA/focus) is deferred to a future heavy lane. Unit-tested
  (11 cases) + adversarially verified.
- Container (Dockerfile) hygiene gate (ADR-0044): `14_container` +
  `meta_harness.container` — the deterministic, threshold-free slice of matrix #4
  (SRE / operational). Native stdlib Dockerfile parse (multi-stage, line-continuations,
  comments, registry `host:port`, digests) reports violations for a per-project rule
  set `[container].require`: `non_root` (final stage must end on a non-root `USER`),
  `pinned_base` (external `FROM` pins a non-`latest` tag or digest; `scratch`/`$`-var
  exempt), `healthcheck` (a `HEALTHCHECK` is declared). No Dockerfile ⇒ pass. A
  run-and-exit gate-runner omits `healthcheck`; a service keeps the full set. Fixes
  borromeanRings's **own** image (was root — added a non-root `USER`) and dogfoods
  `["non_root", "pinned_base"]` on it; the full set is validated against AutoApply's
  real service Dockerfile (flags its missing HEALTHCHECK). Unit-tested (13 cases) +
  adversarially verified.
- ADR-discipline gate (ADR-0043): `13_adr` + `meta_harness.adr_discipline` — on a
  feature branch (name starts with `[adr].require_prefixes`, default `feat/`), a
  change that touches `src` must also add/modify an ADR under `[adr].dir`
  (`docs/adr/`), so a new capability can't land with no recorded decision. Fills
  coverage-map rows D/H; deterministic, threshold-free, git-derivable (merge-base
  diff, `--relative` so it works for git-root and subdir projects). The buildable,
  no-telemetry slice of the delivery/process matrix. Native, unit-tested +
  adversarially verified.
- Secret-scanning completeness (ADR-0042): `74_secret_history` (heavy lane) scans
  every blob reachable from any ref for high-confidence secrets — a
  committed-then-deleted secret still lives in history and is compromised.
  Reachable-only (dangling objects excluded), fail-closed, deduped by a one-way
  fingerprint (the secret is never emitted); acknowledge rotated/benign findings
  via `[secrets].history_allow`. Native (`meta_harness.secret_history`),
  unit-tested + adversarially verified. Also hardens `12_secrets` to **fail
  closed on a non-git directory** (was a vacuous pass — found in rollout).
- Adoption helper for existing projects: `adopt.sh` + `meta_harness.adopt` —
  migrates a project already governed at the founding baseline onto the newer
  quality/security checks. Plans the missing recommended set (`12_secrets`,
  `11_changelog`, `32_complexity`, `33_coupling`, `45_docstrings`), seeds each
  ratchet's baseline from current state, creates a `CHANGELOG.md` if needed, and
  rewrites `[checks].required` in place. Idempotent, native, no installs.
  Complements `init.sh` (new projects); piloted on `reliefq` 7 → 12 checks green
  (ADR-0041).
- Public-API breaking-change detection: `34_api_diff` — diffs the public
  surface vs the merge-base; a removed symbol / removed-renamed param / new
  required param fails unless `[api].allow_breaking=true`. Native ast+git,
  dogfooded on `examples/textkit` (ADR-0040).
- Example governed project: `examples/textkit` — a small library (different
  archetype) with its own `borromeanrings.toml`, governed by borromeanRings's
  gate end-to-end (11 checks). Proves the 'any project' portability claim; a
  permanent integration test asserts its gate passes.
- Coupling ratchet: `33_coupling` — worst-case efferent coupling (fan-out) over
  the internal module graph, non-regression, native (ADR-0038).
- Critic activation: `scripts/critic-judge.sh` (provider-agnostic, fail-closed
  judge — claude CLI or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) + `docs/CRITIC-ACTIVATION.md`; the
  Wave-2 critics are now one config line from live (ADR-0030/0036).
- Agent-enhancement recommender (advisory): `meta_harness.enhancements` — a
  curated, maintainer-verified catalog of open-source tools that improve the
  *wrapped agent* (model routing, MCP servers, observability, caching), with a
  `[enhancements].interests` filter. Proposes, never gates (ADR-0037).
- **Enforcement-coverage program** — turning the SWE best-practice matrix into
  real gates:
  - Adversarial self-test corpus: the gate must reject known-bad and accept
    known-good (ADR-0025).
  - Tamper-evident receipts: content digest + fail-closed verdict, run-digest
    anchor (ADR-0026).
  - Native import-direction architectural fitness: `leaves` / `private` /
    `forbidden` / `forbid_cycles` contracts over the internal module graph
    (ADR-0027).
  - Changelog discipline (this check): presence + `Unreleased` section, with an
    opt-in strict "entry on source change" rule (ADR-0028).
  - Native secret scanning: high-confidence provider tokens + private keys in
    tracked files, fail-closed, `allow-secret` escape hatch (ADR-0032).
  - Docstring-coverage ratchet: native, non-regression, no absolute target
    (ADR-0029).
  - Wave-2 critic rubrics (advisory): `56_critics` judges functions against
    error-handling / naming / security / boundary-value / test-smell rubrics
    via a live model judge; a DRY registry over the doc-drift machinery,
    dormant until `[critic].judge_command` is wired (ADR-0036).
  - Doc-drift critic: first live application of the T2 seam — a model judge
    external to the generator checks docstrings against code; advisory-first,
    opt-in via `[critic].judge_command` (ADR-0030).
  - Cyclomatic-complexity ratchet: native McCabe, worst-case non-regression, no
    absolute ceiling (ADR-0031).

  - Mutation-score ratchet (heavy): `60_mutation` runs mutmut in CI and
    ratchets assertion strength vs `.borromeanrings-mutation-baseline`
    (0.80; current 0.83), fail-closed on 0-evaluated (ADR-0022).
  - License compliance (heavy): `72_licenses` runs pip-licenses in CI and
    denies incompatible copyleft (`[licenses].deny`), with `allow_packages`
    exceptions (ADR-0035).
  - Dependency CVE audit (heavy): `70_pip_audit` runs pip-audit in CI and
    fails on known vulnerabilities; base tooling / accepted CVEs ignorable
    via `[audit]` (ADR-0034).
  - CI-tier heavy lane: `verify.sh --heavy` runs + requires `checks/ci/`
    (`[checks].heavy`), the home for expensive tool-checks; landed dormant
    (ADR-0033).

### Changed
- Enforcement-coverage map corrected to reality: coverage-ratchet was mis-claimed
  ✅ but no check exists (now ❌ candidate); coupling (`33_coupling`), public-API
  breaking-change (`34_api_diff`), and the adoption path (`adopt.sh`) marked ✅;
  doc-drift noted as activation-paused (agent-only, no API keys); added §6 for the
  other governance matrices (security, DORA, SRE, data/ML, product/UX).
- Grouped `tests/` into `unit/` (23) + `integration/` (5 shell-out tests); layout
  threshold back to 15; mutmut ignore paths updated; retires the 30 workaround.
- Enforcement-coverage map refreshed to reflect the shipped suite (T1 filled,
  T2 critic seam + rubric family live-advisory); honest scorecard updated.
- Changelog strict rule (`require_entry_on_src_change`) turned **on** now the
  PR queue has cleared (ADR-0028).

### Notes
- Earlier increments that are in review: mutation-score ratchet (ADR-0022),
  external rubric-critic seam (ADR-0023), project profiler (ADR-0024), and the
  enforcement-coverage map.
