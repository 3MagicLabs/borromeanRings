# Changelog

All notable changes to borromeanRings are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Discipline is enforced by check `11_changelog`: this file must exist and carry an
`## [Unreleased]` section (a home for pending changes). The stricter
"every source change updates the changelog" rule is available via
`[changelog].require_entry_on_src_change` and will be enabled once the current PR
queue is merged.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Enforcement-coverage program** — turning the SWE best-practice matrix into
  real gates:
  - Adversarial self-test corpus: the gate must reject known-bad and accept
    known-good (ADR-0025).
  - Tamper-evident receipts: content digest + fail-closed verdict, run-digest
    anchor (ADR-0026).
  - Native import-direction architectural fitness: `leaves` / `private` /
    `forbidden` / `forbid_cycles` contracts over the internal module graph
    (ADR-0027).
  - Changelog discipline (this check): presence + `Unreleased` section, with an
    opt-in strict "entry on source change" rule (ADR-0028).
  - Native secret scanning: high-confidence provider tokens + private keys in
    tracked files, fail-closed, `allow-secret` escape hatch (ADR-0032).
  - Docstring-coverage ratchet: native, non-regression, no absolute target
    (ADR-0029).
  - Wave-2 critic rubrics (advisory): `56_critics` judges functions against
    error-handling / naming / security / boundary-value / test-smell rubrics
    via a live model judge; a DRY registry over the doc-drift machinery,
    dormant until `[critic].judge_command` is wired (ADR-0036).
  - Doc-drift critic: first live application of the T2 seam — a model judge
    external to the generator checks docstrings against code; advisory-first,
    opt-in via `[critic].judge_command` (ADR-0030).
  - Cyclomatic-complexity ratchet: native McCabe, worst-case non-regression, no
    absolute ceiling (ADR-0031).

  - Mutation-score ratchet (heavy): `60_mutation` runs mutmut in CI and
    ratchets assertion strength vs `.borromeanrings-mutation-baseline`
    (0.80; current 0.83), fail-closed on 0-evaluated (ADR-0022).
  - License compliance (heavy): `72_licenses` runs pip-licenses in CI and
    denies incompatible copyleft (`[licenses].deny`), with `allow_packages`
    exceptions (ADR-0035).
  - Dependency CVE audit (heavy): `70_pip_audit` runs pip-audit in CI and
    fails on known vulnerabilities; base tooling / accepted CVEs ignorable
    via `[audit]` (ADR-0034).
  - CI-tier heavy lane: `verify.sh --heavy` runs + requires `checks/ci/`
    (`[checks].heavy`), the home for expensive tool-checks; landed dormant
    (ADR-0033).

### Notes
- Earlier increments that are in review: mutation-score ratchet (ADR-0022),
  external rubric-critic seam (ADR-0023), project profiler (ADR-0024), and the
  enforcement-coverage map.
